# Active Learning by RL
Use build_agent.py to run the example I made.
This is the step to train the agent.

Requirement : 
	- numpy
	- sklearn
	- tqdm
	- tensorflow == 1.x
	- matplotlib
	- pickle

Environment :
	- anaconda env
	- linux

To run the example that the paper represented, do the following :
Use 'build agent example.ipynb' to train an AL agent with reinforcement learning and use 
'test agent example.ipynb' to run an AL experiment to test an agent and other baselines. 
The agent will be stored in ./agents and the results of AL experiment will be stored in 
./AL_results.
